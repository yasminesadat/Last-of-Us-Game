# Last-of-Us-Game
This project is a survival game implementation inspired by the famous "Last of Us" game. It uses Java's OOP features along with the JavaFX library to bring the game to life.

Important Note: The fonts and sizing are adjusted to a 16.1in display. I'm currently working on a more generic version for all features.

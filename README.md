# Last-of-Us-Game
This project is a survival game implementation inspired by the famous "Last of Us" game. It uses Java's OOP features along with the JavaFX library to bring the game to life.

The game was developed and can be run on the Eclipse IDE. Additionally, the JavaFX SDK needs to be installed. Their links are provided below.

The testing file is a JUnit file that ensures the correctness of the game dynamics. A JUnit library must be installed to run it.

Important Note: The fonts and sizing are adjusted to a 16.1in display. I'm currently working on a more generic version for all features.
